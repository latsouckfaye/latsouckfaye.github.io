Since November 2023, I have held the position of **Temporary Teaching and Research Associate** (*Attach√© Temporaire d'Enseignement et de Recherche*) at the University of Lille. I actively contribute to multiple academic programs, notably the *BUT in Data Science* and various *Professional Bachelor's* degrees, delivering courses across diverse topics.

My teaching portfolio covers a wide spectrum of statistical methodologies, from **Descriptive analysis** to **advanced statistical modeling**. I design and lead lectures, tutorials, and hands-on sessions employing industry-standard tools such as **R**, **Python**, **Excel** and **SAS** to equip students with practical data analysis and programming skills.

Beyond classroom teaching, I have successfully supervised numerous student projects, guiding them through the application of statistical techniques and data science principles to real-world datasets. This mentorship fosters critical thinking and practical problem-solving, ensuring student success in their academic and professional pursuits.

My research is centered on the **analysis of large-scale and complex spatial data**, where I develop and implement innovative statistical models tailored to address challenging problems in **biostatistics** and related fields. I have authored peer-reviewed publications that propose novel methodologies for spatial data analysis, reflecting my commitment to advancing the scientific community's understanding of complex data structures.
